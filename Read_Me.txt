During the process of database creation we realized we needed certain changes in the Schema, hence we applied the required changes and updated the Schema diagram. We have attached the updated files along with source codes.

We have used PHP,MySQL,HTML and CSS for the project execution.

We have included a screenshot of th index page of the application.

All tasks assigned were successfully completed with a good user interface created using HTML and CSS.

CarRentalSQL.sql is the data file represnted the database of our project.

Source codes of all PHP, HTML and CSS files are present in the Source_codes and SQL_files folder.
